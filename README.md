# 🛡️ Wazuh SIEM Lab: Manager & Agents Deployment

This repository documents a **Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab**, built to simulate a corporate cybersecurity monitoring environment.  
It includes a **Wazuh Manager** deployment, multiple **agents** on Windows and Linux, and a complete logging, alerting, and dashboard setup.

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

- **Wazuh Manager** (central SIEM for log aggregation and alerting)  
- **Wazuh Agents** deployed on Windows and Linux endpoints  
- Real-time monitoring for system events, authentication, file integrity, and network activity  
- Dashboards for visualizing security alerts and trends  
- Safe environment for **Red Team / Blue Team exercises**

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture
[Windows/Linux Agents] ---> [Wazuh Manager] ---> [Elasticsearch + Kibana] ---> [Dashboard]


- **Agents**: Collect logs and monitor endpoints  
- **Manager**: Aggregates logs, applies rules, triggers alerts  
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores event data  
- **Kibana**: Visualizes logs and alerts
